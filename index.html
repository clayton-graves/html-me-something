    <h2>Colorado</h2>
    <p>I have spent a few summers sightseeing around many places in Colorado. During my trips my family and I passed through many small towns searching for the next good hiking trail. Colorado is a very beautiful state and I plan on returning with a better camera.</p>

    <h2>Chicago, IL</h2>
    <p>I have been to Chicago a few times but last summer was the most memorable. I spent four days in Chicago for a music fesival hosted in Douglas Park. My friends and I had just enough time to squeeze in some well worth sightseeing.</p>

    <h2>Myrtle Beach, SC</h2>
    <p>In the summer of 2013 I had the pleasure of camping at a K.O.A (Campground of America) that was within walking distance of the beach. The beach was clean and pretty and when it became boring there were plenty of touristy things (mini golf, mirror maze, etc.) to keep me entertained.</p>

    <h2>Tampa Bay, FL</h2>
    <p>Two years ago I made the trip to Tampa to visit an old friend. We had fun and it looked like the city had much to offer, sadly I was not yet 21. While staying in Tampa my friend and I also toured around the neighboring city of St.Petersburgh.</p>
